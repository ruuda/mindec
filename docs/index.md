# Musium

Music playback daemon with a web-based library browser.

Musium is an album-centered music player designed to run on an always-on device
connected to speakers. Playback can then be controlled from anywhere on the
local network.

## Features

 * Respects album artist and original release date metadata.
 * Designed to scale to hundreds of thousands of tracks.
 * Optimized to run in resource-constrained environments, such as a Raspberry Pi.
 * Responsive design, supports both for mobile and desktop.

## Getting started

Musium needs to be built from source. See the [building](building.md) chapter
of the docs. It expects files to be tagged in a particular way, see the
[tagging](tagging.md) chapter for more information.
