# Configuration

Musium reads all settings from a configuration file. The location of the config
file is passed as an argument to the program. Config files consist of key-value
pairs with `=` separator, and support `#` for comments.

## Example

    # Note: listening on port 80 requires CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE.
    # If you want to run as an unprivileged user, use a port beyond 1024.
    listen = 0.0.0.0:80

    library_path = /home/media/music
    covers_path = /var/cache/musium/covers

    audio_device = UMC404HD 192k

## Options

The following options are available. Unless noted otherwise, all options must be
specified exactly once.

### `listen`

The address and port to bind to, for example `0.0.0.0:80`. Use `0.0.0.0` as the
address to listen for external connections, to make the player available to the
entire local network, or use `localhost` to listen only on loopback.

The listen address is optional and defaults to `0.0.0.0:8233`.

### `library_path`

The directory to recursively scan for flac files.

### `covers_path`

The directory to store cover art thumbnails in. These are generated by the
`cache` subcommand, and served by the `serve` subcommand. The directory must
exist.

### `play_log_path`

The file to write json-formatted playback events to. The format consists of one
json object per line, where every object represents a single event. The play log
path is optional: when not set, play logs are not written.

### `audio_device`

The <abbr>Alsa</abbr> card used for playback. When the configured card cannot
be found, Musium will list all of the cards that are available. Musium uses the
<abbr>Alsa</abbr> hardware device directly, there is no need nor support for
PulseAudio.
