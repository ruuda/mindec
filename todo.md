# To do

 * [ ] Ability to pause
 * [ ] Artist screen that shows all albums by an artist
 * [ ] Display the play queue
 * [ ] Remove items from the play queue
 * [ ] Rearrange the play queue
 * [ ] Create playlists manually
 * [ ] Generate playlist from previous play count statistics
       E.g. tracks listened often in the past but not recently,
       albums recently added to the library, etc.
 * [ ] Persist index to SQLite to avoid re-scan at startup
 * [ ] Re-index without restart (hot reload)
